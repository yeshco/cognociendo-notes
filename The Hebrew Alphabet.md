# The Hebrew Alphabet

Nowadays the Hebrew alphabet looks pretty squarish in a form that for the past 2000 years the world has been pretty familiar  with, which is some variation of this:

This blocky font called by our sages כתב אשורית, the Assyrian script, is interesting enough related to the most famous script of the modern world: the [latin letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet), which by being derivated from the greek letters, can also trace their roots to the first “[Abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad)”[^*] in history: The old Hebrew script!

Now before I get to show you and talk about the old Hebrew alphabet I need to explain what an “Abjad” is. Abjad basically refers to a script that uses symbols to express bits of sounds that make up the longer sounds human use to express themselves and describe the world. This concept was and is a massively revolutionary idea, prior to this scripts used symbols that expressed whole ideas, they were mini drawings that were tied together to express bigger ideas. These type of scripts famously used in ancient Egypt in their [Hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs) and by the [Chinese](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%E5%A7%93%E8%A7%A3_Digidepo_1287529_00000014(2)_(cropped).jpg#/media/File:%E5%A7%93%E8%A7%A3_Digidepo_1287529_00000014(2)_(cropped).jpg) nowadays, require a massive amount of symbols to be stored, since they represent by themselves whole different concepts which the real world has an abundance of. Abjads and Alphabets massively simplified this by having symbols just for the most simple sounds our throats and mouths could make, that then could be stringed together to form the words that represented the concepts themselves. Since there’s much less simple sounds our mouth can make that concepts in the real world this simplified the symbols massively. 
> But also this created a change in you aren’t expressing yourself through symbols -> you’re looking at how ideas are expressed by humans -> sounds -> lets just describe sounds.




[^*]: Im using Abjad here to also include Alphabets the main idea in both being that symbols express particular sounds and not ideas
