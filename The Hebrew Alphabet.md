# The Original Hebrew Alphabet

Nowadays the Hebrew alphabet looks pretty squarish in a form that for the past 2000 years the world has been pretty familiar with, which is some variation of this:

This blocky font called by our sages כתב אשורית, the Assyrian script, is interestingly enough related to the most famous script of the modern world: the [latin letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet), which by being derivated from the greek letters, can also trace their roots to the first “[Abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad)”[^*] in history: The old Hebrew script!

Now before we start talking about the old Hebrew alphabet we need to explain what an “**Abjad**” is. 

### Abjads

Abjad like Alphabets are scripts that use symbols to express bits of sounds that make up the longer sounds humans use to express themselves and describe the world. The difference between them is that Alphabets also contain symbols for vowels while Abjads need extra symbols to describe<?> vowels. But its important to note that Alphabets were derived from Abjads and this revolutionary idea of using symbols for sounds and not concepts was first introduced by Abjads.

Prior to this scripts like the famously used in ancient Egypt in their [Hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs) and the one used by the [Chinese](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%E5%A7%93%E8%A7%A3_Digidepo_1287529_00000014(2)_(cropped).jpg#/media/File:%E5%A7%93%E8%A7%A3_Digidepo_1287529_00000014(2)_(cropped).jpg) to this day, used symbols that each represented a specific idea. Because of this they required a massive amount of symbols to be stored, since the real world has an abundance of different concepts that these symbols need to each point to. 

Abjads and Alphabets massively simplified this by having symbols just for the most simple sounds our throats and mouths could make, that then could be stringed together to form the words that represented the concepts themselves. Since there's much less simple sounds our mouth can make that there is concepts in the real world this simplified the symbols massively. 

### Origins

So who where and when created this revolutionary idea and used it first?

The answer to this is geographically clear: It was here in the near east the region that is now Israel, Lebanon and a bit of Syria that this script was first used. Its also kind of clear when was this tool discovered, it was around the 10th century BC maybe a bit before, at a time where this region started to shed its Egyptian influence (in the aftermath of the bronze age collapse) and started to create a unique history for themselves.

This History was being created simoultaneously by three groups of people (and a fourth one close to the desert). These were 1. The Israelites 2. The Canaanites/Phoenicians 3. The Philistines

#### The Israelites

The newest of them all, they displaced most of the canaanites that were living in the mountaneous center region of the land in between the coastal plain and the desert in the east.

#### The Canaanites/Phoenicians

The oldest group, it almost fully dissapeared as it was under Egyptian influence, and gave place in most of the region to the conquering Israelites, but many researchers think the Phoenicians who started being influencial in the northern coast of Israel and south of modern day Lebanon, where of a similar stock as the Canaanites.

#### The Philistines

A warrior nation probably not from the area that started inhabiting the south of the coastal plain of Modern Israel.

The fourth group are the three small nations that lived in between the Jordan the dead sea before and the desert. 

The Philistines were probably not the originators of the script, they spoke a different non semitic language and their earliest encryptions using this script is dated more to the end of the 10th and beggining of the 9th Century.

So researchers have decided for years now to call this script: Phoenician, why ? well we can only guess, Cartaghe the famous enemy of the Romans the originators of Western Civilization used this script 

In fact it would make more sense to say this script originated simoultaneously with the Israelites too

But the oldest "Phoenician incription" has been actually found in a 100% Israelite settlement: Bet Guvrin

[^*]: Im using Abjad here to also include Alphabets, the main idea in both being that symbols express particular sounds and not ideas
