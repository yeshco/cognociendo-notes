# Pelishtim

A strong aggressive/warring nation[^E], probably the remnants of some of the sea people who brought about the bronze age collapse.
So probably Mycenaean people[^D] who left the aegean island after their civilization collapsed.

Their name comes probably from the word פלישה = invasion[^F]. They were probably called the invaders because they weren't from there[^A].
##### Timeline
- Around the year ~1200 a group of Mycenaeans clash with Egypt[^G], they lose the battles but not the war, Egypt starts falling into a long decline where they loose their authority over Canaan.
- This Mycenaeans bands take advantage of that and displacing the previous inhabitants[^C] of the coast settle there a deserts throw away from Egypt.
- At around the same time Israel being slaves of Egypt for 200+ years finally escape Egypts prompted by the 10 plagues that Egypt suffered.
- Their aim is the land of Canaan but God decides they will not to go trough the Mycenaean encampments and instead will go into the desert[^B].
- 40 years later Israel comes out the desert and enters Canaan from the east and starts conquering the land.
- The mountains are completely conquered for Israel, but they don't attack the Mycenaeans (except maybe the cities that encroach on the mountain (old Mycenaeans?).
- Most of Israel settles in the land and relaxes, but the tribe of דן has most of his inheritance allotted to him in the plain just north of the Mycenaeans cities.
- Fighting alone against them is impossible to דן *since the Mycenaeans are much more technologically advanced*[^H] so they decide to also look for other places to settle and parts of them end up in the north[^I].
- For 150+ years there's probably not many issues with the Mycenaeans/Pelishtim since most of Israel doesn't touch them, Yehuda has an humongous track of land in the mountains and Dan is divided in two.
- But after that the growing families of Dan in the south probably start encroaching onto the Pelishtim and that's when a man from one of the original cities of Dan on the frontier with Yehuda starts looking for trouble in the lowlands and the plains with the Pelishtim.
- This fighting will only intensify as the nation of Israel starts uniting and probably wanted to rule over all nations around them.
- But what is interesting even then was that Israel never kicked the פלשתים out completely and they stayed there until the Assyrians came

[^A] *There were פלישתים at the time of אברהם and יצחק too... so maybe Mycenaeans had already settled on that coast (like greeks would in later years settle all over the mediterranean) although not in the same cities but a bit more inland*. The reason why dorians might have later on not settled on the coast of Israel might have been do to these Myceneans who spoke another language.
[^B] Going trough the coast to Israel right after leaving Egypt would have meant literally going trough the encampments of a freshly arrived horde of warriors (probably bloodlusted from fresh battles (Vikings of antiquity)). 
[^C] The pasuk in Devarim [2:23] says that Caftorim (from crete? (mycenea)) moved the "Avim" from their location close to Aza
[^D] *The Pelishtim apparently eat some kind of pig that comes from the aegean, their pottery is also similar to greek pottery*
[^E] *The personal guard/fuerzas de elite of David is made of כרתי and פלתי (Cretans/Pelishtim ?) (makes one remember of the Varingians)*
[^F] "The invaders" which is interesting that that's the name the Palestinians kept up until now. It's interesting that the west always called this land by the name of it's western Invaders. The name was probably popular among greeks and then romans for the land of Israel because when they came from the sea this was the land that received them.
[^G] *Raamses III talks about "Peleset" people he fought that then settled in the "Amori" land*
[^H] Apparently *Israel even went to the Pelishtim to get iron weapons*
[^I] This is the story of פסל מיכה
