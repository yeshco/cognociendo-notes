# Waves

The world is based on Oscillations.

How many natural things do we model as waves?

1. Electromagnetic waves
2. Sound waves
3. Gravitational waves

This are concepts that touch at the center of reality and they can all be modeled as waves!

**What are waves? How we defined them?**

Waves are oscillations of a certain thing we are measuring that move it from one place to another.

What do you measure in a wave?

1. Amplitude: the maximum oscillation
2. Wavelength: the distance between two crests
3. Frequency: the number of oscillations trough time
