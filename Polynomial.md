### Polynomial

An algebraic expression that has more than one [term](<Algebraic Term.md>):

$a+3$  and  $\frac{a}{b}+\sqrt{3}$ are polynomials of two terms each, they can also be called **binomials** 

$a+3-4b$  and  $a^7b+\frac{2}{a}\div5b$ are polynomials of three terms each, they can also be called **trinomials** 



##### Types of Polynomials

Polynomials can be divided in the same way [Terms](<Algebraic Term.md>) divided:

1. Whole

2. Fractional

3. Rational and Irrational

   **Homogenous and Heterogenous**

   When the [**Absolute Degree**](<Algebraic Term.md>) of all it's terms is the same:
   $$
   4a^6 +b^4c^2
   $$
   They are Homogenous and when they're not they're Heterogenous

   

##### Full Polynomial

When a polynomial has a complete sucession of exponents in a **literal**:
$$
a+a^3+a^4+a^2\\
b3+a^5+c^2+a^4-a^3
$$
In both cases the **literal** $a$ has a full sucession of exponents in the first case from $1$ to $4$ , and in the second case from $5$ to $3$



##### Organized Polynomial

When the full polynomial (maybe even if it's not full?) is organized in an **ascending** or **descending** fashion:
$$
a+a^2+a^3+a^4\\
b^43+a^5+b^3+a^4-a^3\div b^2
$$
The first case it's **ascending** for $a$, and in the second case it's **descending** for $b$ 



##### Independent Terms

When a **term** in a polynomial doesn't include a certain literal 
$$
2a+5a+3
$$
$3$ is an independent with respect to $a$
