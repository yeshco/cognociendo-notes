# אתחלת דגאולה

It seems to me that for many the process of this second שיבת ציון was a process that reached its climax with the establishment of the State of Israel. Both דתיים & חילונים though differing in the meaning of the process often assumed that the founding of the state was itself the fulfillment of a long-awaited dream. And now, with the state fully established—wealthy, prosperous, ranked among the world’s top twenty economies—many on both sides are left with a lingering sense that something essential wasn’t accomplished.

For the secular Zionist who had a dream of building the best country a humanist worldview could conceive of, a utopia of an egalitarian society grounded in socialism, manual labor, and the redemptive power of working the land. A vision of a new kind of Jew, forged in the sun and soil of Eretz Israel, the land of their forefathers.  In the early years of the state, this vision seemed within reach. But over the past four decades, it has steadily unraveled. Cultural and demographic shifts, along with repeated political defeats, have revealed a country moving in a direction starkly different from the one they had once dreamed of. Disillusioned, many have begun to look elsewhere.

The religious nationalist in contrast didn’t get at the establishment of the nation any of what they were looking for, since they were at the time a very small and neglected minority. But as their demographic and political power began to grow in the latter half of the state's development, and they saw the possibility of a real, thriving Jewish Religious presence in the land, the energy shifted: we need everything now! Settle the whole of the land now, bring redemption now, rebuild the בית המקדש—now. The possibility of their dream became tangible, and with that came the demand for immediate fulfillment. But that fulfillment wasn’t immediate, and now after four decades of striving to align the country to their vision, their impetus and drive has slowed down, and they’ve begun to settle into the reality of things. 

And I’ll admit—I’m not above it either. I long for a utopian ישראל, one that fuses the best of רוחניות and גשמיות into a society that’s both holy and whole. I want to see it—not in some distant, abstract future, but now. Or at least within the next 50 years. But as time passes and the present seems far away from preparing that future I can’t help but fear: maybe we missed our chance. Maybe because of that in another hundred years, or less, we’ll be forced to leave again. Maybe we lost the prize.

I think a lot of people feel the same way—like the ideals have quietly died out, and all that’s left is to enjoy whatever we’ve built, for as long as we still can. It’s less about a vision for an even better future and more an acceptance to do with the reality of what we have. And with antisemitism rising again around the world, the sense of fragility only deepens. Which sometimes leads to an unwavering faith in the people and the land but without any constructive vision for it, this is what we have—let’s hold onto it as much as we can.

But what if that whole perspective is not the correct one? Yes, this land has a history of spitting us out when we’re not “good enough”—but what if “good enough” means something very different than we assume? What if ה׳ is far more ארך אפים, than we give Him credit for? What if these ~80 years have really only been the אתחלתא דגאולה? Maybe we’re meant to stay longer than just a century more, because we are meant to grow here, to slowly become better until משיח comes!

Truthfully, we have no idea how any of this will unfold. Maybe what I’m saying is true, or maybe the gut feeling of a scared עם ישראל will be the reality. But I think there are two points we have to consider. First: the last time we were in this land, we stayed for way more than 200 years—and to be honest, this second return feels closer to יציאת מצרים, which lasted 800 years, than to שיבת ציון from בבל. We were buried so deeply in exile that this feels like building something completely new, from the ground up. Second: no matter how long we’re here, one thing is clear—deep spiritual and cultural change takes time. And as everyone knows, putting ourselves or others on a ticking clock rarely helps—especially when it comes to the spirituality of others, which requires patience, compassion, and care.

So if what we need most is time and patience, then let’s choose that as our guiding perspective, ה׳ just wants us to try our best. Maybe the journey here has only just begun.
