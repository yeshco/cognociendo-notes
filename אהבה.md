# אהבה 
According to רב קוק it’s one of the fundamental attitudes you should have in life.

He says in his ספר המידות:
אהבה צריכה להיות מלאה בלב לכל
What does this mean, where could this emotion come from?

I think it comes from giving to everything that you see and exists its proper place and value. You like/love everything because everything has a certain aspect of good in it. כמובן if you believe in God this makes a lot of sense and the love of everything in a way could be coming from the love you have of him. But even if you don’t a deeper look at reality makes this apparent, everything has its value and place and hence everything is in some way worthy of love.
