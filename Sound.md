# Sound

Sound is just how your brain interprets the waves of molecules generated by some vibration when the wave hits your eardrums.

These waves travel through mediums like air, water, or solids at different speeds.

The speed of sound in air at sea level is approximately 343 meters per second (1,125 ft/s).

Sound cannot travel through a vacuum, which is why there is no sound in space.

The human ear can typically detect sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
