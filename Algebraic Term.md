### Algebraic Term

An algebraic expression

##### Elements of an Algebraic term:

1. The Sign
2. The [Coefficient](Coefficient.md)
3. The Literal
4. The Degree

Take for Example: $-4a^2b^4$

The $-$ **Sign** indicates that this Term is [Negative](<Absolute Value.md>)

The **Coefficients** are each one of the factors

The **Literals** are $a$ and $b$ 

The **Degree** is the sum of the value of the exponents of it's **literals**, so:

$5a^4b$ has a degree of $5$

$6ab^7c^2$ has a degree of $9$

And you can also say that in the first case $a$ has a 'relative' degree of $4$, and in the second case it has a relative degree of $1$

##### Types of Terms

1. Whole
   1. A term that has no **literal** [denominator](Denominator.md) eg: $5a$ or $\frac {2a}{3}$
2. Fractional
   1. When it has a **literal** [denominator](Denominator.md) eg: $\frac {2a}{b}$ (is $\frac{2a}{2b}$ also fractionary?)
3. Rational and Irrational
   1. When the term doesn't have a root and Irrational when it has eg: $\sqrt{a}$ or $\frac{3b}{^3\sqrt{2a}}$

##### Others:

1. Homogenous Terms
   1. Terms that have the same absolute **degree** eg: $4a^5$ and $a^2b^3$ both have a degree of $5$ 
2. Heterogenous Terms
   1. When their absolute degree is disimilar

##### Similar Terms

Terms that their same literals with the same exponents:

$3a^2$ is similar to $a^2$
